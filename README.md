# Akvo RSR Up

This is the Akvo RSR Up project that provides mobile applications to support the Akvo RSR project.

The first public launch of the app has been created to provide RSR project update functionality to users with Android devices.

Users can browse their RSR projects, view eixsting updates as well as create new updates. Images can be added directly from the users image library or taken on the spot using the devices camera. Completed updates can be sent straight away or saved for later when back in the office or with connectivity for example.

The app has been published in the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.akvo.rsr.up) and will shortly also be published in the [F-Droid store](https://f-droid.org/).

We have [user documentation](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr-mobile/wiki/User-guide) as well as an [instructional video](http://youtu.be/NMuE2OI_trE) available.
