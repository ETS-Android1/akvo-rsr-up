# Akvo RSR Up

This is the Akvo RSR Up project that provides mobile applications to support the Akvo RSR project.

The first public launch of the app has been created to provide RSR project update functionality to users with Android devices.

Users can browse their RSR projects, view existing updates as well as create new updates. Images can be added directly from the user's image library or taken on the spot using the device's camera. Completed updates can be sent straight away or saved for later when back in the office or with connectivity for example.

The app has been published in the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.akvo.rsr.up) and will shortly also be submitted for inclusion in the [F-Droid directory](https://f-droid.org/) of free and open source Android apps.

We have [user documentation](https://github.com/akvo/akvo-rsr-mobile/wiki/User-guide) as well as an [instructional video](http://youtu.be/NMuE2OI_trE) available.
